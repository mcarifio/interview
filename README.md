# Interview

Interview questions I've been posed ... and finally solved :-). Think of this as the adult version of posting college
rejection notices. I had a fair amount of those too.

## Layout

I try to do interview questions in python3 to speed things along. It hasn't always worked.

The repo uses [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#simple-python-version-management-pyenv) for the environment and 
[pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the local modules. In this way, the global environment should remain pristine.
[Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) has built-in support for pipenv style projects. 

This project uses the [python guide structure recommendations](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/) with `interview` as "the module". 

## area.py

area.py is a combinatorics and recursion problem. I got the recursive nature of the problem, but didn't discover 
that I would recount parts of the grid without a supporting data structure to terminate the recursion.

## palindrome

## repeat_count


# TODO

* Add travis-ci building. Configure regression testing on check-in.
