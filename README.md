# Interview

Interview questions I've been posed ... and finally solved :-). Think of this as the adult version of posting college
rejection notices. I had a fair amount of those too.

## Layout

I try to do interview questions in python3 to speed things along. It hasn't always worked.

This repo is an eclipse/pydev project.

## area.py

area.py is a combinatorics and recursion problem. I got the recursive nature of the problem, but didn't discover 
that I would recount parts of the grid without a supporting data structure to terminate the recursion.
