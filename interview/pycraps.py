PyCraps

In this exercise we will model a simplified game of craps as commonly played in casinos. The game involves 2 6-sixed dice and an object to track the game state.
At any given time the game state is in 1 of 2 states. Described as the "point" being on or off. If you know craps well, for this exercise we are ignoring all the negative bets such as
"DO NOT PASS". If you don't know what that means, just ignore it.

When the game begins, the point is off. When the point is off the following rules are in place:

dice result:
2, 3 or 12 -> "Craps" game resets, dice to move to next shooter, house takes all bets on table
7 or 11 -> winner, house doubles all bets
 -> set the point to the resulting number. No bets win or lose, same shooter rolls again Example: shooter rolls a 5, the point is now "on" and set to 5. Game is now hit this number again before hitting a 7.

When the point is "on", dice rules are as follows:
7 -> "craps", point is now off, house takes all money, dice move to next shooter
2, 3, or 12 -> "craps" but point remains on, no bets lose or win. Shooter rolls again.
4,5,6,8,9,10 -> if this number is the current point, the shooter wins his original bet, the point is now off and the game starts over. If this number is not the current point, no bets win or lose and the shooter rolls again.

***** REQUIRED *****
1. Model a die that when rolled produces a random number between 1 and 6 inclusively.

2. Model the craps game to keep track of 2 dice objects, the players at the table, which player is the current "shooter",the current point (if there is one), and the total bets on the table

3. Run the game by setting the first player as the shooter, and following the rules as above. Each time a new shooter starts or they win their point, every player should bet $100. When a player "craps out", the house (your game object) should collect the winnings from all players who bet. When a player hits their point and the game resets, their original bet should be returned to them as double.

4. Run the game with 1 player at the table starting with $1000. Run the game until he craps out when a point is set.

5. Run the game until either the player or the house runs out of money.

***** BONUS *****
1. Add multiple players to the table, where each time a player craps out the shooter is the next player in the list

2. Keep track of the highest and lowest balances of a player so at the end they have a number to brag about or cry about.

2. Add the concept of negative bets. So players at the start of a game (or when the point resets) randomly choose to either bet "with" or "against" the current shooter. When the point is off, betting against the shooter means you lose when the shooter makes a point or hits 7 or 11.

***** EXAMPLES *****
1 player at table
game starts
player 1 becomes current shooter
player 1 bets $100
shooter rolls 11.
house pays shooter $200 for winning
game resets
game starts
player 1 becomes current shooter
player 1 bets $100
shooter rolls 2
house collects $100 bets (all bets on table)
game resets
game starts
player 1 becomes shooter
player 1 bets $100
shooter rolls 5
point is now 5
shooter rolls 8
shooter rolls 3
shooter rolls 5
house pays all betters double their bet
player 1 is still shooter, point is off
game starts...

# Implementation Notes

Plays a simplified game of craps based on the rules above. Dice, Rolls and players have their own classes. All players, including the house, can bet. The house never shoots (rolls dice).
Bets are mechanical. Each player bets $100 on each round. The game ends when the house or all players are busted.

The implementation uses python logging to trace the game similar to the transcript above (but not exactly).

All dollar amounts are represented as `int` representing USD.

itertools.cycle is a cute way to cycle the available shooters in order until the game is over. Once a shooter is busted, he remains in the cycle but is just skipped.

This implementation experiments with python3 properties which are used to annotate getter/setter functions. This provides some data encapsulation/protection not normally
provided by python. It's a useful pattern to master.

This implementation experiments with the python 3.7 `dataclass` annotation, used to simplify the implementation of the data class pattern. More at https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/. I like the concept,
jury's still out on the detail.

This implementation experiments with type annotations in function signatures. This is supposed to help IDEs, e.g. Pycharm, code complete better. This seems to be true, especially to disambiguate overloaded functions,
such as Bettor/Shooter win() and lose(). I haven't tested this systematically, however, and Pycharm always has a billion moving parts.
