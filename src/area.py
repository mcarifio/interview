Problem posed:

Given a 2D integer array, where each element can be 1 (represents white) or 0 (represents black). Write a function which calculates the largest contiguous white area.

0 0 1 0
1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0
1 1 0 0

yields 7

I didn't complete this during the interview process. Finished it about an hour later.
